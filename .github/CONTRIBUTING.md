# Contributing

## Request for changes / Pull Requests
You first need to create a fork of the [WowOS](https://github.com/Wowstar2504/WowOs) repository to commit your changes to it. Methods to fork a repository can be found in the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstar/fork-a-repo).

Then add your fork as a local project:

```sh
# Using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/Wowstar2504/WowOS.git

# Using SSH
git clone git@github.com:Wowstar2504/WowOS.git
```

> [Which remote URL should be used?](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories)

Then, go to your local folder:

```sh
cd WowOS
```

Add git remote controls:

```sh
# Using HTTPS
git remote add fork https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/WowOS.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Wowstar2504/WowOS.git


# Using SSH
git remote add fork git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/WowOS.git
git remote add upstream git@github.com:Wowstar2504/WowOS.git
```

You can now verify that you have two git remotes:

```sh
git remote -v
```

## Receive remote updates
In view of staying up to date with central repository:

```sh
git pull upstream master
```

## Choose a base branch
Before starting development, you need to know which branc to base your modifications/additions on. When in doubt, use master.

| Type of change                |           | Branches              |
| :------------------           |:---------:| ---------------------:|
| Documentation                 |           | `master`              |
| Bug Fixes                     |           | `master`              |
| New Features                  |           | `master`              |
| New Issues Models             |           | `YOUR-USERNAME:patch` |

```sh
# Switch to the desired branch
git switch master

# Pull down any upstream changes
git pull

# Create a new branch to work on
git switch --create patch/1234-name-issue
```

Commit your changes, then push your branch to your fork with `git push -u fork` and open a pull request on [WowOS](https://github.com/Wowstar2504/WowOS) following the template provided.
